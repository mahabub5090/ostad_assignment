    <h4>My favourite three foods and descriptions is given below:-</h4>
      <ul>
           <li>Mango</li>
                <p> The fruit varies greatly in size and character. Its form is oval, round, heart-shaped, kidney-shaped, or long and slender. The smallest mangoes are no larger than plums, while others may weigh 1.8 to 2.3 kg (4 to 5 pounds). Some varieties are vividly coloured with shades of red and yellow, while others are dull green.</p>

           <li>Orange</li>
                <p>The orange is a usually round or oval citrus; its rind and flesh are generally orange, except the varieties of red pulp. The edible part of the orange is the flesh, consumed in fresh or in juice. The orange is also used to make stewed fruit, jams, for consumption as dehydrated fruit, etc.</p>
       

          <li>Banana</li>
                <p>One serving, or one medium ripe banana, provides about 110 calories, 0 gram fat, 1 gram protein, 28 grams carbohydrate, 15 grams sugar (naturally occurring), 3 grams fiber, and 450 mg potassium.</p>

      </ul>
